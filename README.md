ðŸ§© **Purpose**

This project consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors to support targeted marketing, customer profiling, and strategic analysis.

---

### ðŸŒŸ **Highlights**

1. Extracts essential customer details such as names, ages, and transaction history.
2. Segments customers into meaningful categories: **VIP**, **Regular**, **New**, and age groups.
3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
    - Total orders
    - Total sales
    - Total quantity purchased
    - Customer lifespan (in months)
4. Calculates key performance indicators (KPIs):
    - **Recency** (months since last order)
    - **Average Order Value (AOV)**
    - **Average Monthly Spend**

### ðŸ›  **Process Overview**

### ðŸ“¥ Data Setup

To begin, I created two base tables â€” `dim_customer` and `fact_sales` â€” and loaded the necessary data into each.

### Step 2: Aggregation

Summarized key **customer-level metrics**: total sales, orders, quantity purchased, distinct products, last order date, and **lifespan.**

### Step 3: Segmentation & KPI Calculation

Enhanced customer profiles by:

- Assigning **age groups** (e.g., "30â€“39", "50 and above")
- Segmenting customers by engagement: **New**, **VIP**, or **Regular**
- Calculating:
    - **Recency** (months since last order)
    - **Average Order Value**
    - **Average Monthly Spend**

The result is a consolidated customer report in tabular form, ready for business reporting or dashboard integration.
